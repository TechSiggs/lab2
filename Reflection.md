# My Reflection / Blog
Hello everyone, This weeks lab introduced my to Github and why people use it. This was the first time I was ever exposed to the service so it took me a little bit to get use to it. For my screencast, I explained what a pull request is and how it is used. A pull request is a way for you to tell the "master" and everyone else working on the project that your changes are ready to be viewed/edited by everyone else. You normally make a pull request when you are done working on a section of a project. Overall, github seems like a very useful tool for coders or anyone who works in web design. I look forward to increasing my knowledge about github as well as getting better and more creative with my videos.
